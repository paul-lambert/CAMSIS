
** Value labels for ISCO-88(com) unit groups. 
** Produced by Paul Lambert, University of Stirling (update: 10 Feb 2012). 
*******.
* The labels were taken from the ILO website : 
* http://www.ilo.org/
* the IPUMS website :  
* http://www.ipums.org/
* and the website of the Social Straification in Eastern Europe project  
*  (this introduces a number extra labels to ISCO-88(com) which are sometimes used in datasets
* covering Eastern European countries) : 
* http://archiv.soc.cas.cz/SSEE/
*******.
* As well as 4-digit unit groups, labels are given for 3-, 2- and 1-digit codes and 4-digit codes with 'trailing zeros' 
*  (e.g. both 24 and 2400 are included as alternative means of indicating sub-major group 24). 
* Numeric ISCO codes are included within the labels for convenience. In the case of 3-, 2- and 1-digit codes, the 
*   numeric code in the label is not the same as the actual numeric code (a possible confusion)
*   (e.g. the entry for numeric code 2400 is "24 OTHER PROFESSIONALS"). 
*******.
* The labels are available in SPSS format from the CAMSIS project webpages: 
* http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/
* The conversion to Stata format was originally achieved by applying Dirk Enzmann's SPSS2Stata
*  conversion script 
* http://www2.jura.uni-hamburg.de/instkrim/kriminologie/Mitarbeiter/Enzmann/Software/Enzmann_Software.html .
