
** Value labels for ISCO-08 unit groups and major/sub-major/minor groups. 

** This Stata file was generated by Paul Lambert, University of Stirling 
**  (updates: 10 Oct 2012; 22 Jun 2016). 

** The 4-digit labels were originally copied from a file published by Harry Ganzeboom at: 
**  http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/isco08/index.htm 

** Cited as: 
**   Ganzeboom, Harry B.G.; Treiman, Donald J., “International Stratification and Mobility File: Conversion Tools.” 
**         Amsterdam: Department of Social Research Methodology, http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/ismf/index.htm. Retrieved: 10 Oct 2012. 
**

** The 1-, 2- and 3-digit labels were transcribed from the ILO publication on the structure of ISCO-08:
**   http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/structure08.docx 
**



** Additional information

** 4-digit labels: 'isco08_label': 
** 3-digit labels: 'isoc08_min' 
** 2-digit labels: 'isco08_submaj'
** 1-digit labels: 'isco08_maj' 
 
** In the 4-digit label, labels are given for 4-digit unit groups, 
** and labels are also given for 3-, 2- and 1-digit units as characterised by trailing 
** zeros (e.g., the label for submajor group 21 is given as '2100'. 
** The four digit labels sometimes use the abbreviation 'arw' for 'and related workers' 

** For the 2-digit and 3-digit versions, the armed forces categories are labelled without 
*   the proceeding zero, e.g. 2-digit submajor group 2 = Non-commissioned officers (=02)

** Apostrophes when appearing within original labels have been stripped out
**  e.g. "835 Ships’ Deck Crews and Related Workers"  becomes "..Ships Deck Crews.." etc
