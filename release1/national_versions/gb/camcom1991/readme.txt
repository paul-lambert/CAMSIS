These files cover 3 versions of the same dataset in plain text, SPSS 15 and Stata 10 format. 

The data lists UK Standard Occupational Categories 1990 (SOC90), with corresponding employment status categories (8 possible values). Each row of data represents one unique combination of SOC90 and employment status. 

For each row of data, additional information on several popular occupation-based social classifications is given: 

RGSC = Registrar General's Social Class
GOLD = Goldthorpe class scheme
CAMSCM = Cambridge Scale score for males
CAMSCF = Cambridge Scale score for females 
SEG = Socio-Economic Group

The original data was prepared by analysis and manual review conducted by Ken Prandy in as part of his work in developing the Cambridge Scale (see Prandy 1990). These data files have sometimes been referred to as the 'Prandy codes'. The information from these data files was used directly in the CAMCON software, which was a component part of the CASOC software (see Elias et al 1993). This was the most common tool for coding occupational data used by major UK survey projects in the 1990s. Therefore, many major surveys used these codes to derive occupation-based social classifications from their occupational unit group data. 

The additional formatting of the plain text data into SPSS and Stata formats was undertaken by Paul Lambert in 2008.
