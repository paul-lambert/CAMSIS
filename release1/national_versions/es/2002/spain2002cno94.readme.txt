1) CAMSIS Scales

The CAMSIS scale scores represent an occupational unit's relative position within the national order of social interaction and stratification. Different versions of the scale are produced for different countries and, in some cases, time periods. It is a standard outcome of the methods used that different scores are obtained for men and women.

The CAMSIS scores supplied are re-scaled representations of the 'raw' scores generated by 'RC-II' association models applied to patterns of social interaction between occupational unit groups, as defined in the relevant classification (CNO-94). We use the same re-scaling parameters for every CAMSIS version, namely that a nationally representative population's distribution of scale scores should have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 15. Higher scores reflect, in our interpretation, greater advantage along the stratification dimension which the scores represent. Additionally, we impose the constraint that all re-scaled scores which would fall outside the range 1-99 are 'cropped', to a minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 99. (In practice this constraint affects very few occupational unit scores.) Although, strictly speaking, the CAMSIS scores reflect only the differentiation of occupational unit groups within a specific version, this re-scaling does ensure a reasonable degree of comparability between versions; that is, they all represent the same order of distance from the version-specific mean. This property is especially relevant in the comparison of scale scores between gender groups, as discussed below.

In the first instance, many researchers may be interested in a descriptive review of the qualitative structure of the CAMSIS scores for the version relevant to them. This is most easily done by looking at the ranked order of occupational unit groups by their within-gender CAMSIS scale scores. In a few cases, such tables are provided on the associated web pages, but it is a simple matter to sort the SPSS index files by scale score. Using SPSS, switching on the 'view value labels' option will usually show the text labels for each occupational unit group; remember, though, to sort back to the original order (ascending occupation and status in employment) before attempting to match files.

2) Occupational Unit and Status in Employment Groups 

CAMSIS versions are created using the data available for a particular country at a particular time, using the occupational classification scheme to which the data are coded. In some cases it is possible to use datasets that are close in time, but have been coded to an alternative classification - most usually, the International Standard Classification of Occupations. In other cases, we have made use of a conversion scheme to convert the scores from one classification to another. Such conversions are rarely wholly satisfactory, but they are probably adequate. This version uses the SPANISH NATIONAL CNO-94 occupational classification, and data from the 2002 LABOUR FORCE SURVEY. FOR ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF THE CNO-94 PROVIDED BY JORGE RODRIGUEZ, SEE http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/CAMSIS/occunits/distribution.html#Spain. Because CAMSIS scores are themselves comparable accross countries, it is thus not necessary to recode data from national specific schemas in order to conduct cross-nationally comparative research. 

Although we recommend using the fine detail of any occupational classification whenever possible, there are situations where data are only available at a more aggregate level, coded, say, into 'minor' or even just 'major' group. Where appropriate, the index files include scores for groups at these higher levels of aggregation. Wherever possible, we have tried to use what appears to be the standard way of coding these aggregated groups. AGGREGATED SCORES FOR 1-DIGIT LEVEL 'MAJOR GROUPS' AND 2-DIGIT LEVEL 'MINOR GROUPS' ARE PROVIDED HERE. SCORES FOR THE 'MAJOR GROUPS' 0-9 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMERICAL VALUES 10000-10009 ON THE 'CNO94' VARIABLE, AND SCORES FOR THE SUBMAJOR GROUPS 0-98 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE VALUES 20000 TO 20098 ON THE SAME CNO94 VARIABLE. 

In addition to occupation, strictly defined, many countries collect information on status in employment, for example, whether someone is self-employed or an employee. Differences in employment status of this kind could be regarded as, in effect, defining different occupations, and this is how they are treated in CAMSIS. The files supplied provide for both the standard national classification of employment status (AS AVAILABLE FROM THE SPANISH 2002 LABOUR FORCE SURVEY) and a standardised form that can be used in international comparative analysis. The tables of scores allow users to make use of more and less detailed employment status categories, including one for no information, that is, an occupational title only version. THIS VERSION HAS TWO EMPLOYMENT STATUS VARIABLES, THE STANDARDISED VERSION (STDEMPST) AND THE VERSION AVAILABLE FROM THE 2002 LABOUR FORCE SURVEY (SPEMPST).

It is possible for users to match their data with appropriate CAMSIS scores using information on occupational title alone or occupational title in combination with employment status. The occupational title variable should be numerically equivalent to the occupational title units used for the relevant CAMSIS version (CNO-94). If it is relevant for the particular country, an employment status variable can also be used, coded to match the index files (SEE BELOW). If there is no information on employment status, this will need to be set to '0'; this is necessary even if employment status is missing for every case, in order to avoid duplications in the look-up file. In some cases, coding the employment status variable may require cross-classifying information from more than one source variable. (Normally, users should take care to code as 'not known' (0) any cases where employment status situation as defined in the CAMSIS scheme is not completely clear.)

STDEMPST
      0 "Status unknown (spempst 1-4)"
      1 "Self-employed (all) (spempst 1-3)"
      2 "Self-employed (principals) (spempst 1 or 2)"
      3 "Own account (ISCE-93 3) (spempst 2)" 
      4 "Employer (ISCE-93 2) (spempst 1)"
      5 "Family worker (ISCE-93 5) (spempst 3)"
      6 "Employee (ISCE-93 1) (spempst 4)"  .

SPEMPST 
      0 "Missing, not known"
      1 "Self-employed with employees"
      2 "Self-employed without employees"
      3 "Family worker"
      4 "Employee"   . 



Matching to Data Files

The CAMSIS index files are normally made available only in SPSS format or as ASCII (plain text) files. Versions in other formats could be provided on request. The SPSS version is the most convenient and is likely to be the most commonly chosen.

Within SPSS, assuming that the user has a data set in which each record has one or more variables relating to occupation (e.g. respondent's present job, previous job, spouse's job, father's job), the index file functions as a look-up table using the SPSS Merge files/Add variables function. Assuming two variables "occ" (CNO94) and "empst" (SPEMPST or stdempst) relating to a particular occupation, all that is needed is, first, to sort by "occ" and "empst", then to match with the index file:

sort cases by occ (a) empst (a). 
match files /file=*
  /table='spain2002cno94.sav'
  /rename (cno94=occ) (spempst=empst) 
  /by occ empst .
execute.

(IF SOME OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION WAS KNOW AT ONLY A 'MAJOR' OR 'SUBMAJOR' GROUP LEVEL, IT WOULD ALSO BE NECESSARY TO RECODE THE APPROPRIATE VALUES OF THE 'OCC' VARIABLE TO THE MAJOR AND SUBMAJOR GROUP INDICATOR VALUES (10000-10009 AND 20000-20098 RESPECTIVELY).

The occupational index files supplied have a unique record for each possible combination of occupational title "occ" (CNO94) and employment status "empst" (SPEMPST OR STDEMPST). Associated with each are the relevant CAMSIS scale scores, for men "mcamsis" and women "fcamsis". The most convenient way to deal with the different scores is first to set a variable, say "camscor" equal to "mcamsis", then to change the value to equal "fcamsis" on any cases where the occupation holder is female. (There may be situations, though, where it is thought desirable to retain both values for each occupation. In particular, it could be argued that it would be more appropriate to assign the male score to women's occupations if men and women are being compared as to the 'desirability' of their occupational locations - see below.)

Remember that for each occupational variable for which CAMSIS scores are being added the file will have to be re-sorted. Remember, also, that for those countries where employment status is not included (more strictly, where it is included - for the sake of consistency - but with a constant value of '0'), sorting and matching can be done using "occ" only.

Gender Groups

A leading FAQ concerns handling different scores for male and female occupations. It is important to remember that the CAMSIS scales are derived within the context of gender groupings; the male scales represent the ranking of the occupations of males in a hierarchy of social interaction, and the female scales a ranking of those of females. Thus, for example, there is no necessary relationship between the values of an occupation on its male and female scales (although they are likely to share similar relative locations).

An implication is that the analysis of social stratification through occupations graded by the CAMSIS measure is ideally appropriate only within gender groups. Indeed, it is a little misleading, albeit a commonly made mistake, to analyse a mixed gender population through CAMSIS scores which are the male scale scores for the men and the female scale scores for the women. The occupational scale indexing used for men and women is invariably the same, further giving the impression of equivalent meanings. However the CAMSIS methodology assumes different systems of relative positions prevail within the male and female occupational structures, and hence implicitly that equivalent titles are not necessarily the same between genders.

There are however two data arrangements where, if the use of a mixed gender population is a substantive priority, use of CAMSIS scale scores for that population can be supported. If either are adopted, we would also recommend that researchers using modelling techniques consider terms which represent the interaction between the CAMSIS scale values and gender, since the patterns associated with such terms may shed light on the relative influence of gender differences.

Firstly, it may be plausible to represent the occupational position of both men and women through their scores on the scale derived solely for male occupations. This position would represent a 'conventional' view on occupational locations, that among the working population the advantages of occupations for all workers follow the hierarchy of the predominantly full-time, lifelong career, male occupational structure.

Secondly, an alternative account would note the fact that we have re-scaled all CAMSIS scores within versions to have the same mean and standard deviations. Because of this, male and female scores have some equivalence, in that they represent each occupation's average position with respect to the population of men for men, and women for women. Because of this, the CAMSIS scale representation alluded to above, namely the commonly used attribution of male scores for men and female scores for women, whilst imperfect, is defensible.
